        "# TennisIQ: Real-Time Injury Prevention for Tennis Players\n",
        "\n",
        "TennisIQ is an initiative to develop a real-time injury prevention system designed to monitor wrist motion in tennis players and provide actionable insights to reduce the risk of tennis elbow and other overuse injuries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using wearable inertial sensors, TennisIQ aims to continuously track angular velocity and acceleration of the wrist during tennis strokes, identify patterns linked to injury risk, and deliver immediate feedback to players and coaches to improve technique and prevent injury.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since access to large-scale real-world tennis sensor datasets is currently limited, this notebook starts by generating synthetic wrist motion data that closely mimics forehand and backhand strokes. This synthetic data will be used to build and validate data processing pipelines and machine learning models capable of detecting risky movement patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ultimate goal of TennisIQ is to evolve into a practical, scalable solution that integrates with consumer wearables, empowering tennis players of all levels to train smarter, play safer, and extend their careers.\n",
